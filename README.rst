Sample-v3.py and Sample-v4.py - the sample code with some code that I added for testing purposes
- using these will use api credits
- historical odds pulls cost 10 credits
current_odds_analysis.py - currently takes up to date info and calculates the shin percent/odds for each team
- using this will use api credits
historical_odds_analysis.py - using as a testbed to run calculations on historical data
- using just the data in the pre pulled dates will not use api credits
json_export_of_historical_data.py - will eventually be used to pull all of the historical data into json format
- planning on implementing loop using datetime library in iso format, then cycling through days and saving to individual json files.
